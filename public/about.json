  "bio": "Like the Chicory plant after which they are named, the two performers of Duo Cichorium are not native to Ontario, but have taken root in Toronto’s cultural environment. Together, percussionists and interdisciplinary artists Jasmine Tsui and Louis Pino strive to synthesize their aesthetic values with their artistic practices: playfulness, absurdity, and abstraction in conjunction with music performance, improvisation, integrated custom electronics, and visual art. The duo possesses a uniquely wide skill set, ranging from electrical engineering and software programming, to video animation and fabric craft. This versatility in combination with a collective 4 decades of musical study allows Duo Cichorium’s practice to span from intimate acoustic chamber music performances to eye and ear straining multimedia works. Duo Cichorium has been invited to perform self curated programs for multiple concert series around Toronto — ELEMENTAL for The Music Gallery’s You In Mind series, where they premiered their epic concert-length multimedia piece The Elemental Suite; and PLAY for ArrayMusic’s Behaviors series, where they premiered their audience participatory Super Smash Bros. 64 game piece — and is currently one of Tranzac Club’s 2024 Ensembles in Residence.",

    "They are truly multi-faceted artists, skillful in a dizzying array of mediums; not only concert music, but visual arts and dance and computer science along with a impressive fluency with sound creation and technology. The phrases ''risk taking'' and ''boundary pushing'' have been repeated to the point of banality, which is sad because these two actually take these duties seriously. \n-Gregory Oh, New Music Revolutionary",
    "Duo Cichorium's Smash Bros. piece set the tone for my kids' enjoyment of the evening, and I think I'll be able to entice my kids to come to more stuff at Array because of it!\n -David Schotzko, ArrayMusic Artistic Director"
