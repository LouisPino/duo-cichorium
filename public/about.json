  "bio": " is comprised of interdisciplinary artists Jasmine Tsui and Louis Pino. Like the Chicory plant, the two performers are not native to Ontario, but have taken root in the environment of Toronto following their tertiary education. Together, they strive to synthesize their aesthetic values with their artistic practices: playfulness, absurdity, and abstraction in conjunction with music performance, improvisation, integrated custom electronics, and visual art. The versatility of their practice spans from intimate chamber pieces to eye and ear straining multimedia works. Jaz and Pino have both received Masters degrees from the University of Toronto studying under Aiyun Huang, Beverley Johnston, and Charles Settle.",

  "quotes": [
    "They are truly multi-faceted artists, skillful in a dizzying array of mediums; not only concert music, but visual arts and dance and computer science along with a impressive fluency with sound creation and technology. The phrases ''risk taking'' and ''boundary pushing'' have been repeated to the point of banality, which is sad because these two actually take these duties seriously.\n -Gregory Oh",
    "Duo Cichorium's Smash Bros. piece set the tone for my kids' enjoyment of the evening, and I think I'll be able to entice my kids to come to more stuff at Array because of it!\n\n -David Schotzko, ArrayMusic Artistic Director"
