    "bio": "Duo Cichorium is comprised of interdisciplinary artists Jasmine Tsui and Louis Pino. Like the Chicory plant, the two performers are not native to Ontario, but have taken root in the environment of Toronto. Together, they strive to synthesize their aesthetic values with their artistic practices: playfulness, absurdity, and abstraction in conjunction with music performance, improvisation, integrated custom electronics, and visual art. The versatility of their practice spans from intimate chamber pieces to eye and ear straining multimedia works. Jaz and Pino have both received Masters degrees from the University of Toronto studying under Aiyun Huang, Beverley Johnston, and Charles Settle."

    "bio": "We like to make noise ranging from ambient and meditative soundscapes to ooky spooky sonic assaults. Sometimes we incorporate visual art, spoken word, projected media, and live processing. It's a mystery what sort of sounds we'll be utilizing next but there will be a melodica, some jingle jangles, and a whole lot of crunch."
