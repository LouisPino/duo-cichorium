    "description": "A four-movement music, art, and electronic extravaganza co-composed by Jaz Tsui and Louis Pino. Each movement utilizes customized electronic systems corresponding to a respective element of matter.\nMatchbox Ritual is a cyclical ritual between states of peace and chaos completed by two performers, both completing and beginning their journeys while briefly meeting in the middle. \nMorphogenesis features a handmade tree sculpture with custom projection art using OBS-based mapping; the sound and visuals reflect a sunset, a night storm, followed by the breaking of dawn. \nDesiderium uses DIY hydrophones, capturing the sounds of water and instruments within it; sounds are processed in Ableton Live, creating a soundscape that explores island caves, a vibrant shore, and the depths of the ocean. \nScintillation combines the MUGIC motion sensor, Arduino, and Max, to allow the performers to control the wind (electronic fans) to activate several sets of windchimes — an aleatoric soundscape evoking a spring day in a breezy field.",

    "description": "This piece invites audience members to play a live game of Super Smash Bros. 64. Button input from the players is captured and analyzed by Max to manipulate aspects of the electronic sound. The percussionists are each assigned a character to sonically represent in performance, creating a unified ensemble between the game players, percussionists, and electronics, all driven by gameplay.",

    "description": "An independent study (supervised by Bev Johnston) that explores interdisciplinary-driven improvisation with live graphic scores. The objective was to create an interactive piece of performance art within the online sphere, building a virtual installation that the observer can either view, listen, or interact with. An interview portion was also conducted, gathering input from all performers on their process for realizing a graphic score and how their participation in other art forms contributed to their viewing, listening, and playing. A heartfelt thank you to Connor Crone (Double Bass), Trevor Flemings (Piano), Amanda Lowry (Flute), Charlee Wielgoz (Cello), Holly Winter (Clarinet), Nolan Hildebrand (No Input Mixer), and Chris Wiens/None (Audio Mixing)",
